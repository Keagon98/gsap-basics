## What is GSAP?

**The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is an industry-celebrated suite of tools used on over 11 million sites, including more than 50% of award‑winning ones! You can use GSAP to animate pretty much anything JavaScript can touch, in any framework. Whether you want to animate UI, SVG, Three.js or React components - GSAP has you covered.

The core library contains everything you need to create blazing fast, cross-browser friendly animations. This is what we'll be stepping through in this article.

In addition to the core, there are a variety of plugins. You don’t need to learn them in order to get started, but they can help with specific animation challenges like scroll based animation, draggable interactions, morphing, etc.**
